<p ID="namemeet"><img src="/home/cqst/MEET ILP. html/IPL IMAGE1.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).[1] Founded in 2007, the league features ten state or city-based franchise teams.[2] The IPL is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world and is held between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[3] It is also the most viewed sports competition in India, as per BARC.[4][5]

In 2014, it ranked sixth in attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established.[a][11][12] In 2022, the league's brand value was estimated at ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[13] According to the BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to India's GDP.[14] In December 2022, the IPL achieved .</p>

<h2><a name= "popularity of IPL">POPULARITY OF IPL</a></h2>
<p><img src="/home/cqst/MEET ILP. html/IPL IMAGE3.jpeg"/>Do you think the popularity of IPL cricket is fading outside the subcontinent?

While the league continues to break revenue and broadcasting records in India, it feels like fewer people are talking about it—at least in the cricket circles I’m a part of and those that I follow on social media.

I’m asking this in light of Harry Brook opting out of the tournament again, a decision that seemed to be met with little more than a shrug of india.</p>

Since the 2014 season, player contracts have been denominated in the Indian rupee, before which the contracts were in the US dollar. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player's choice, at the exchange rate on either the contract due date or the actual payment date.[60] Before the 2014 season, Indian domestic players were not included in the player auction pool. They could be signed up by franchises at a discrete amount while a fixed sum of ₹10 lakh (US$12,000) to ₹30 lakh (US$35,000) would be deducted per signing from the franchise's salary purse. This received significant opposition from franchise owners, who complained richer franchises were "luring players with under-the-table deals." The IPL later decided to include domestic players in the player auction.</p>
